# Module 11 Challenge
In this assignment we use splinter and BeautifulSoup to scrape data from various websites, and then filter and analyze that date. 

The Jupyter notebook files are located in the Starter_Code folder, and output CSV's are located in the Output folder.

Module was completed working with study group partner Muneeb Samad.
